description: The single-writer rule for GameRoom, non-blocking event fan-out, and the invariants enforced in review.
---

These rules are enforced in code review. They exist because the server is authoritative over
live games: a stalled fiber or a trusted client field is not a cosmetic bug here, it is a
corrupted or frozen game.

## One writer per room

A `GameRoom` has **a single consumer fiber, and it is the only writer of game state**. Requests
do not mutate a room; they hand it an intent, and the room's own fiber applies it in order.
That is what makes the state machine reasonable without locks — and it is why introducing a
`synchronized` block or a shared mutable field around a room is a design error rather than an
optimisation.

## Fan-out must never block the room

Events reach subscribers — WebSocket clients, ndjson streams, webhook dispatch — through
**bounded per-subscriber queues, written with a non-blocking `tryOffer`**. If a subscriber is
not draining its queue, its event is dropped and, past the bound, the subscriber itself is
dropped. The room does not wait. A single slow consumer must never be able to stall a game for
its opponent.

## Rooms know nothing about transports

A room depends only on `Principal`, `Seat`, and `PlayerConnection`. It never references a
WebSocket, an HTTP response, or a webhook. Adding a transport means implementing
`PlayerConnection`, not touching `GameRoom`.

## The server trusts nothing from the client

No code path may accept a client-supplied FEN, dice roll, clock value, or result. Legality is
decided by `EngineOps` against the engine artifact; dice come only from `DiceSource`. This is
not defence in depth against a hostile bot alone — it is what makes the provably-fair dice
promise meaningful.

## Effects and lifecycles

Everything is cats-effect `IO`. No nulls, and no exceptions for control flow — errors are
returned as values (`GameRegistry.create` returns a `Left`, for instance). Lifecycles are
`Resource`; background fibers are scoped with `.background` / `.surround` so a failure surfaces
instead of vanishing.

## The dice path is a public promise

`dice/DiceSource.scala` implements commit-reveal fairness: a SHA-256 commitment published up
front, HMAC-SHA256 rolls mixing in client entropy, length-prefixed framing. Third parties
verify their games against the published procedure. Changing this file requires golden test
vectors **and** the matching update to the public verification procedure on
[bots.jc.id.lv](https://bots.jc.id.lv/provably-fair/), in the same pull request.

## A trap worth knowing before you write a test

A game with an **idle seat and no clock deadlocks**. From the starting position only pawns and
knights can move, so a roll containing neither makes the room auto-pass to the other seat; with
an unlimited time control and nobody driving that seat, play stops forever. It is
dice-dependent, so it fails roughly 30% of the time and looks exactly like a timeout bug — it
has twice been misdiagnosed as fiber starvation and "fixed" by widening a timeout. If a test
needs a specific seat to get an actionable turn, drive the opponent rather than assuming the
opening roll falls that seat's way. See [Testing](/dicechess-play-api/testing/).
