  * Scheduler-produced games arrive continuously and the batch applies them in `finished_at` order, so windowing would
  * add bookkeeping without changing much; τ regularises the volatility update well enough at this scale. Idle-time RD
  * inflation (Glicko-2's "did not compete in a period" rule) is deliberately NOT applied — on-ladder bots play
  * continuously by construction (the scheduler pairs them), so there is no meaningful idle time to model yet; revisit
