/** The Glicko-2 rating batch (#119): a single background fiber that drains the claim queue of rated, not-yet-applied
  * `game_results` rows (oldest first) and updates both participants' `bots.glicko_*` state — per game, in one
  * transaction with the row's `rating_applied_at` stamp, so a crash can neither double-apply a game nor lose one side's
  * update. Runs OUTSIDE the game write-path (the roadmap's "zero load on the game flow" holds); single fiber = single
  * writer, so rating reads-then-writes never race themselves.
  *
  * Every game is its own one-game rating period for both participants, applied in `finished_at` order — see
  * [[Glicko2]]'s doc for why (and for the deliberate absence of idle RD inflation). Both sides update from the same
  * PRE-game snapshots, the standard simultaneous treatment.
  *
  * Games the update can never apply — a participant that is not a registered bot (humans arrive with accounts later), a
  * missing result, self-play — are logged and stamped applied anyway: left unstamped they would sit at the head of the
  * queue forever.
  *
  * '''Ladder auto-park (#150)''' rides along here. A bot whose last `ladderTimeoutParkGames` ladder games were all lost
  * on the clock is opted out of the ladder — `on_ladder = false`, exactly what `POST /bot/ladder/leave` writes — which
  * stops a dead bot bleeding rating all night AND stops every opponent it is paired with banking free timeout wins. The
  * check lives in the batch rather than in `LadderScheduler` because the batch already visits every finished rated game
  * exactly once: it costs one extra bounded query on the rare timeout loss and nothing at all otherwise. There is
  * deliberately no auto-rejoin — returning is an explicit `POST /bot/ladder/join` by the owner, since an automatic
  * cooldown would just send a still-offline bot back out to bleed again.
  *
  * The park write is a separate transaction from the rating write it follows, so a crash between them leaves a rating
  * applied and the bot still on the ladder. That is deliberately not worth a shared transaction: the streak is
  * re-evaluated from scratch on the bot's next timeout loss, which an actually-offline bot supplies within a minute.
  *
  * '''The [[StrengthCache]] refresh (#181)''' also rides along here rather than on its own timer or the `/strength`
  * request path, but on its own much slower cadence (#215) — see `tick`'s doc.
  *
  * Constructed through [[RatingBatch.create]] because that refresh cadence is stateful: the batch remembers when it
  * last rebuilt the report and whether games have landed since.
