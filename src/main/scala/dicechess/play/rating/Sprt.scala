/** Sequential Probability Ratio Test for "is bot B stronger than bot A" (E.1, #120) — the Fishtest-style precise
  * verdict, as opposed to the Glicko-2 ladder's rolling estimate. Pure math: no IO, no store.
  *
  * The log-likelihood ratio uses the GSPRT normal approximation (Michel Van den Bergh's formula, the one Fishtest runs
  * on): for observations with sample mean `m` and sample variance `v` of the per-observation score, and hypothesis
  * means `s0`/`s1` (the expected scores at `elo0`/`elo1`),
  *
  * {{{LLR ≈ N · (s1 − s0) · (2m − s0 − s1) / (2v)}}}
  *
  * Two observation kinds contribute additively (independent observations, same hypotheses):
  *   - '''Pentanomial''': one CRN mirror pair = ONE observation with score ∈ {0, ¼, ½, ¾, 1} (the pair's two game
  *     scores summed, normalised by 2). This is the variance reduction the shared dice exist for — the pair's
  *     colour-and-luck noise cancels inside the observation instead of inflating `v`.
  *   - '''Trinomial''': an unpaired rated game = one observation with score ∈ {0, ½, 1} (a fallback; the scheduler
  *     makes these rare).
  *
  * Each family's histogram is smoothed with a small per-bin pseudo-count before `m`/`v` are computed — see
  * `BinPseudoCount` for why that (and not a variance floor) is the degenerate-sample guard.
