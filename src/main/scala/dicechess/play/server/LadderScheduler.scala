/** Background matchmaker for the bot rating ladder (#102): on an interval, randomly selects two on-ladder bots and
  * starts one rated game between them, up to a concurrency cap. Pairings are **server-chosen only** — a bot cannot pick
  * its opponent, so an owner can't farm rating with two colluding bots. MVP policy: uniform-random subject to a
  * one-step anti-repeat (don't immediately re-pick the pair just started, unless it's the only pair available);
  * rating-aware pairing (prefer close ratings / high RD) is a future refinement, not required for the ladder to start
  * producing results.
  *
  * Colour balance across a matchup is a scheduling property, not a by-product of one call spawning two games (#190
  * dropped that CRN mirroring — see the issue for why): the anti-repeat state already tracks each bot's most recent
  * opponent, so alternating colours over successive picks is a natural extension if it's ever worth adding; today each
  * tick starts exactly one game with whichever seats `GameRegistry.create` assigns.
  *
  * `config.maxConcurrentGames` is a **server-wide** ceiling on scheduler-started games. It says nothing about any one
  * bot, which is how a single bot came to be seated in three simultaneous games in production and lost them on time
  * (#188). The per-bot half of that is each candidate's own declared capacity (#189), applied by [[SeatGuard]] below.
