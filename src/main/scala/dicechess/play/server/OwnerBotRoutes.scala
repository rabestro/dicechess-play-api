  * Two credentials reach the same operations, and that is the point of this file. A bot drives itself with its Bearer
  * token through the `/bot` API; its owner drives it with a session cookie through the mirrored routes here. The Bearer
  * paths are untouched — the public Bot API contract must not shift under third-party authors — so this is a second
  * door, not a replacement. Both doors call the SAME helpers in [[BotRoutes]], so a semantic can never diverge between
  * them.
  *
  * Claiming lives here too rather than in `MeRoutes`, so the whole `/me/bots` … surface has one home: `MeRoutes` owns
  * identity and history, this owns bots.
  *
  * '''Not-yours is 403, not 404.''' Hiding a bot's existence from an authenticated owner would protect nothing — the
  * PUBLIC `GET /bots/{team}/{name}` already answers whether a registered bot exists, with its rating. So 404 means "no
  * such bot" and 403 means "it exists and is not yours", which is the more useful pair and leaks nothing new. (#253
  * shipped the release route as 404-for-both out of caution; this PR corrects it to match, for that reason.)
