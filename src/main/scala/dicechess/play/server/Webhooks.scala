/** Synchronous webhook delivery (F.2, #104; design: ADR-0013): when it is a registered bot's turn, the server POSTs the
  * game state to the bot's verified callback URL and applies the HTTP response body as the move — one component
  * covering the ownership handshake (`register`) and the delivery loop (`loop`).
  *
  * '''Single-writer respected''': the per-game runner is an ordinary room subscriber that feeds `submitTurn` — a
  * command source exactly like a WebSocket player or a polling bot, never a second writer.
  *
  * '''Reliability is the clock''': delivery is single-attempt with a bounded timeout (`min(config, the mover's
  * remaining clock)`); on timeout / non-200 / garbage the runner does nothing — the room's own deadline forfeits the
  * game exactly as it would for a polling bot that stopped polling. No retries, no dead-letter, no dispatcher state.
  *
  * '''Delivery rate is structurally bounded''': a bot receives at most one POST per turn of a game it is seated in,
  * games are bounded by the scheduler's pair cap and the challenge flow — there is no queue an attacker could pump. The
  * registration endpoint (the only caller-triggered outbound POST) carries its own per-IP limiter in the routes.
  *
  * The scan loop discovers rooms via `registry.list` (cheap: an in-memory map), so webhook runners attach for games
  * however they started — challenge, seek, ladder scheduler — and re-attach automatically after a restart's `resume`.
  * Deliveries re-read the registration per turn, so a `DELETE /bot/webhook` or a re-register (new URL/secret) takes
  * effect at the next turn, not the next game.

    * webhooks (routes + dispatcher) and bounds each delivery attempt; the effective per-turn timeout is additionally
    * capped by the mover's remaining clock.
    *
    * Sizing it is a deployment decision, and it is a *cap*, not a promise: what a given bot actually gets is
    * `min(its remaining clock, this cap, whatever its own hosting allows)`.
    *
    * The floor is what the engine's `TimeManager` legitimately asks for — on Fischer(600,10) its target reaches ~57 s
    * once `movesToGo` bottoms out, and ~68 s on a clock the increment has grown (observed in production). Configure
    * below that and correct bots get truncated mid-thought.
    *
    * The intermediaries in front of the bots are deliberately NOT the ceiling here, because they differ per bot and
    * belong to their authors: a Cloudflare-proxied endpoint is cut at 100 s, an OCI API Gateway at 60 s, an AWS API
    * Gateway at 29 s by default. A bot behind a narrower limit hits it first and its proxy answers — which this server
    * logs as `endpoint answered HTTP …`, a diagnosable outcome, unlike the silent truncation an under-sized cap
    * produces. Note that the derived client deadlines sit *above* this value ([[Config.clientTimeout]],
    * [[Config.clientIdleTimeout]]), so a 120 s cap means holding a connection open for up to ~150 s.
    *
    * 120 s is the deployed choice: it clears the engine's hard cap at a 600 s clock and keeps this server from being
    * the binding constraint for bots whose path allows more (Cloud Run 300 s, Azure 230 s). An operator whose bots all
    * sit behind a narrower proxy can configure less and lose nothing.
