/** The immutable, sanitized history record for a finished game (#177) — play's own durable representation of game
  * history, independent of the analytics wire contract (`PlaysiteIngest`) and of `games` snapshot retention (#179
  * prunes ended snapshots once this becomes the serving path for replay, `GET /games/{id}/history`, #178).
  *
  * Unlike `GameSnapshot` this drops the live secrets a client should never retain past the game (seat join tokens);
  * unlike the analytics payload it keeps raw `external_id`s (this table is server-private — anonymization is the
  * READING endpoint's job, via the same `PublicPlayer` rules the live wire uses) and the full fairness block (commit +
  * server seed + client seeds), stored unconditionally.

    * the same anomaly `PgGameStore.finishedGameOf` guards against and logs; guarding here too means a malformed row
