  * Id contract: every `userId`/`guestId` parameter must already be a valid UUID string — the implementation casts with

  * from a session token this server signed, and a client-presented `guestId` must pass `Principal.guest` (the

    *
    * `freshNickname` is a dependency, not a stored value, so the generator (its word lists, its collision widening) can
    * evolve in the auth layer without touching persistence.
    *
    * Concurrency: two simultaneous first logins with the same subject race on the `user_identities` primary key; the
    * loser's transaction rolls back and its retry finds the winner's identity, so exactly one account is ever created.
